Blow Daddy, aww, yeah
Here we are, standing at the hard line
We made it last this long
The two of us, together since the first time
And I believe our love is still strong
Seems love has a funny way
Well, it can come or go or it can choose to stay
But love says what it has to say
(Chorus)
Matter of fact (ooh, as a matter of fact)
I love you (oh, as a matter of fact)
And I love that you love me back
As a matter of fact (ooh, as a matter, a matter)
Some said we wouldn't make it this far
But they don't talk no more (no more)
The love we share is precious as a big star
And what we have's what others hope for
Seems love has a funny way
Well, it can come or go or it can choose to stay
But love says what it has to say
(Chorus)
Matter of fact (ooh, as a matter of fact)
I need you (oh, as a matter of fact)
And I'm glad that you need me back
As a matter of fact (ooh, as a matter, a matter)
Mm, matter of fact, yeah (ooh as a matter of fact)
I want you (yeah, as a matter of fact)
And I can't tell you more than that
As a matter of fact, (ooh, as a matter) yeah (matter)
Aww, blow, Daddy
Musical Interlude
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Seems love has a funny way
Well, it can come and go or it can choose to stay
But love says what it has to say
(Repeat chorus)
Matter of fact (ooh, as a matter of fact)
I love you (oh, as a matter of fact)
Yeah and I love that you love me back
As a matter of fact (ooh, as a matter of fact)
Ooh, ooh, baby
Matter of fact (ooh, as a matter of fact)
I need you (yeah, as a matter of fact)
And I'm glad that you need me right back
As a matter of fact
(Ooh, as a matter) yeah (a matter)
