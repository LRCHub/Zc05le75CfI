I can pay my own light bill baby
Pump my own gas in my own car
I can buy my own shoe collection
I've been blessed thus far
I can kill the spider above my bed
Although it's hard because I'm scared
I can even stain and polyurethane
But some things just don't change
I need you
Sometimes so hard to say
I need you
Some thing remail
I can buy my own groceries baby
Get my hair thight my nails right
I can floss my own bling bling
Write the the words to the songs I sing
I can even raise the child we'll make
Make sure he's loved and knows what God gave us
I can teach him how to walk and stand
But I need you to help him be a man
We need you
Some things don't change
I could be congresswoman or a garbage woman
Or police officer or a carpenter
I could be a doctor and a lawyer
And a mother and a "good gGod what chu
Donet to me?" kind of lover I can be
I could be a computer analyst
The queen with the nappy hair raising her fist
Or I could be much more and a myraid of this
Hot as the summer
Sweet as the first kiss
And even though Ic an do all these things
I need you
And even though I can do all these things
We need you
(And you need us too!)
