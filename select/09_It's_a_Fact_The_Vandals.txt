You know when you're sure
That no one gives a crap
You're on the right track
It's a fact

And when you believe
Things are good
It's guaranteed
You're up your ass
It's a fact

Morons through the world
And it's shitty place
No one ever asked to be born
It's a fact

You know every time
You think you've got it right
You're totally wrong
It's a fact

And when you really try
The efforts misapplied
Or there's a catch
It's a fact

When you've got a sure thing
You're sure to fuck it up
It's one thing you can count on every time
It's a fact

What can you do?
Absolutely nothing
Don't even try to amount to something
It will never work and Hitler is a jerk
And soon we'll all be dead anyway
It's a fact
(You suck)

In five billion years
The sun will explode
It's in the bible
It's a fact

And no one will know
That we were ever here
It's a fact
It's a fact

So rest assured in knowing
That what you do don't matter
Some one can do it better anyway
It's a fact
