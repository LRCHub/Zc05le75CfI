Here lies your scene
Resurrected for the good
All that you are
Is sending back the truth
Can't keep the pace
You're the second hand
Make it worth it
Be what you are
No need to change

So phased for so long
It's the scene
Let me fight the liar that means harm
Just the same old excuses now
Everyone makes

Hide behind your screen
Have you got the shield to form
Keeps me aside
And makes himself worthwhile
You're pride of place
In a made up band
As you come to sow your bland seed
Your three facts fade
